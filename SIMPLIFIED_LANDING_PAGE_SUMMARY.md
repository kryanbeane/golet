# Simplified Landing Page - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The GoLet landing page has been simplified to focus on email capture via Loops, removing search and sign-in functionality while keeping all informational sections intact.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Loops API Integration (`app/api/loops-signup/route.ts`)
- New API endpoint that handles email signups
- Validates email format before submission
- Integrates with Loops API to add contacts to mailing list
- Handles duplicate email submissions gracefully
- Returns appropriate success/error messages
- Requires `LOOPS_API_KEY` environment variable

### 2. Simplified Hero Component (`components/landing/Hero.tsx`)
**Removed:**
- Search input and search button
- "Post a Room" button
- All search-related logic and imports
- Profile completion dialog
- Router navigation logic

**Added:**
- Simple email capture form (email input + "Join Waitlist" button)
- Form validation
- Loading state during submission
- Toast notifications for success/error feedback
- Clean, responsive layout matching existing design

**Kept:**
- Original headline: "The Only Safe way to rent in Ireland!"
- Original description copy
- Responsive grid layout
- Irish audience tone

### 3. Updated Navbar (`components/landing/Navbar.tsx`)
**Hidden:**
- "Sign In" button on desktop view (when user is not logged in)
- "Sign In" button on mobile menu (when user is not logged in)

**Kept:**
- Logo and brand name
- Navigation links (Features, Pricing, FAQ)
- User dashboard/logout buttons (for logged-in users)
- Responsive mobile menu structure

### 4. Environment Configuration (`env-template.txt`)
Added documentation for the required `LOOPS_API_KEY` environment variable.

## All Landing Sections Preserved
The following sections remain visible and functional:
- ✅ Hero (now with email signup)
- ✅ Features
- ✅ Pricing
- ✅ Comparison
- ✅ About
- ✅ FAQ
- ✅ Changelog

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Add Environment Variable
Add the following to your `.env.local` file:
```bash
LOOPS_API_KEY=your_actual_loops_api_key
```

Get your Loops API key from: https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api

### 2. Test the Email Signup

1. Navigate to the landing page
2. Notice the "Sign In" button is hidden in the navbar
3. In the Hero section, you should see:
   - Email input field with placeholder "Enter your email address"
   - "Join Waitlist" button
4. Enter an email address and click "Join Waitlist"
5. You should see a success toast message
6. Check your Loops dashboard to confirm the email was added

### 3. Test Edge Cases

**Invalid Email:**
- Enter an invalid email (e.g., "test@")
- Should show error toast

**Empty Email:**
- Click submit without entering an email
- Should show "Email required" toast

**Duplicate Email:**
- Submit the same email twice
- Should show "You're already on our list!" message

**Network Error:**
- Test with network disconnected
- Should show connection error message

## Technical Details

### API Endpoint
- **URL:** `/api/loops-signup`
- **Method:** POST
- **Body:** `{ email: string }`
- **Success Response:** `{ success: true, message: string }`
- **Error Response:** `{ error: string }`

### Loops API Integration
- Uses Loops API v1 endpoint: `https://app.loops.so/api/v1/contacts/create`
- Adds contacts with source tag: "GoLet Landing Page"
- Handles existing contacts gracefully

### User Experience
- Form submission is disabled during loading to prevent double submissions
- Loading spinner with "Joining..." text during submission
- Email field is cleared after successful signup
- All user feedback via toast notifications (no page reload)

## Notes

- This implementation is for a specific branch (not main)
- Auth pages (`/auth`) remain untouched
- Existing functionality (search, dashboard, etc.) still works for authenticated users
- The page maintains full responsiveness across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- All copy maintains Irish audience tone and cultural nuance
