# Document Sharing for Property Applications - Requirements

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing document upload system to allow users to selectively share their encrypted documents with landlords when applying to properties. The system maintains end-to-end encryption while enabling secure document sharing during the application process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Selection in Application Dialog

**User Story:** As a tenant, I want to select which of my uploaded documents to share with a landlord when applying to a property, so that I can control what information I provide for each application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Apply" on a property listing THEN the system SHALL display an application dialog
2. WHEN the application dialog opens THEN the system SHALL load and display all the user's uploaded documents
3. WHEN documents are displayed THEN the system SHALL show document name, type, and encryption status
4. WHEN a user selects documents THEN the system SHALL provide checkboxes for each document
5. WHEN a user submits the application THEN the system SHALL only share the selected documents
6. WHEN no documents are selected THEN the system SHALL allow application submission without documents
7. WHEN the user has no uploaded documents THEN the system SHALL show a message with link to upload documents

### Requirement 2: Secure Document Sharing

**User Story:** As a tenant, I want my documents to remain encrypted when shared with landlords, so that my sensitive information stays secure throughout the application process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are shared THEN the system SHALL maintain end-to-end encryption
2. WHEN a landlord accesses shared documents THEN the system SHALL decrypt them client-side
3. WHEN documents are shared THEN the system SHALL create secure access links with expiration
4. WHEN sharing documents THEN the system SHALL log the sharing activity for audit purposes
5. WHEN documents are shared THEN the system SHALL only allow access to the specific landlord
6. WHEN applications are withdrawn THEN the system SHALL revoke document access

### Requirement 3: Landlord Document Access

**User Story:** As a landlord, I want to view documents that applicants have shared with me, so that I can make informed decisions about rental applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing applications THEN the system SHALL display shared documents for each applicant
2. WHEN a landlord clicks on a shared document THEN the system SHALL decrypt and display it securely
3. WHEN viewing documents THEN the system SHALL show document type and upload date
4. WHEN documents are accessed THEN the system SHALL log the access for security purposes
5. WHEN applications are old THEN the system SHALL automatically expire document access after 30 days
6. WHEN landlords download documents THEN the system SHALL use original filenames and formats

### Requirement 4: Application Management Integration

**User Story:** As a landlord, I want to see shared documents integrated into my application management workflow, so that I can efficiently review applications with supporting documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the applications page THEN the system SHALL show document count for each application
2. WHEN applications have documents THEN the system SHALL display a documents icon/badge
3. WHEN clicking on an application THEN the system SHALL show document details in the application view
4. WHEN managing applications THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by applications with/without documents
5. WHEN applications are accepted/rejected THEN the system SHALL maintain document access for record keeping
6. WHEN exporting application data THEN the system SHALL include document information

### Requirement 5: Privacy and Security Controls

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control document sharing permissions and see who has accessed my documents, so that I maintain privacy and security of my sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are shared THEN the system SHALL create an audit log of access
2. WHEN users view their applications THEN the system SHALL show which documents were shared
3. WHEN documents are accessed THEN the system SHALL notify the document owner
4. WHEN applications are withdrawn THEN the system SHALL immediately revoke all document access
5. WHEN users delete documents THEN the system SHALL revoke access from all shared applications
6. WHEN document access expires THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up access permissions

### Requirement 6: User Experience and Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive interface for selecting and managing document sharing, so that I can easily control what information I share with each landlord.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting documents THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indicators for selection state
2. WHEN documents are encrypted THEN the system SHALL show security badges
3. WHEN sharing documents THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation of what will be shared
4. WHEN applications are submitted THEN the system SHALL show success confirmation with shared document summary
5. WHEN viewing past applications THEN the system SHALL show which documents were shared
6. WHEN documents fail to load THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages with retry options

## Technical Considerations

### Database Schema Updates
- Add `shared_documents` table to track document sharing relationships
- Add `document_access_logs` table for audit trail
- Update `applications` table to reference shared documents

### Security Requirements
- Maintain end-to-end encryption for all shared documents
- Implement time-based access expiration
- Create secure document access tokens
- Audit all document access attempts

### Performance Requirements
- Document selection dialog should load within 2 seconds
- Document decryption should complete within 3 seconds
- Support up to 10 documents per application
- Handle concurrent document access by multiple landlords

### Integration Points
- Property search/listing pages (application dialog)
- Application management dashboard
- Document upload system
- User profile/account pages
- Notification system for access alerts
